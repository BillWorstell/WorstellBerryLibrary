# WorstellBerry Library

Welcome! This site is a personal, searchable catalog of the Worstell/Berry home library.

Use the links below to browse by **location** (bookcase/shelf). You can also use the
search box in the header to jump straight to a title, author, ISBN, or note.

## Browse by Location

### BookCase 01
- **Shelf 01** → [Index](books/BookCase01/Shelf01/index.md)
- **Shelf 02** → [Index](books/BookCase01/Shelf02/index.md)
- **Shelf 03** → [Index](books/BookCase01/Shelf03/index.md)

## Plans / Roadmap

- **UDC browsing tabs** (grouping items by classification ranges)
- “Related volumes on this shelf” cross-links
- Provenance notes where applicable

---

## Conventions

- Dimensions are approximate when taken from ruler photos.  
- Condition notes are brief and pragmatic (e.g., *“Fair; torn dust jacket”*).  
- If a page says “coming soon,” the record exists in the spreadsheet but the
  Markdown page isn’t written yet.
