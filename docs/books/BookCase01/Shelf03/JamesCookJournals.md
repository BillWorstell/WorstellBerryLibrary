## Why you should read this book

- **First-person discovery:** These are the day-by-day logs of the century’s most consequential navigator. You hear Cook puzzling through reefs, weather, food, crew health, and first contacts.  
- **How exploration really worked:** Practical seamanship, instruments, provisioning, discipline, and shipboard science (longitude, observations, collecting) are here without romance.  
- **Intercultural encounters:** Entrée into the earliest written European accounts of peoples across Polynesia, New Zealand, Australia, the Pacific Northwest, and the North Pacific—essential context for later colonial histories.  
- **Map of the Pacific taking shape:** You can watch coastlines move from conjecture to chart, and see how journals fed the Enlightenment’s appetite for data.  
- **Teaches source criticism:** Comparing editorial framing with the journals trains you to separate log entry, later interpretation, and modern debate.

- **91(3)** — Oceania and the Pacific (general geographic facet; add specific area facets as needed)
