## Notes and use

- **Why on this shelf**: pairs well with _Age of Chivalry_ (illustrated cultural survey) and _Vaults of Memory_ (late antique/early Christian material culture) to bracket the long medieval period with a clear political-institutional spine.  
- **Good for**: quick dating of turning points (Carolingian consolidation; 12th-century renaissance; 13th-century papal monarchy; late-medieval crises), concise descriptions of institutions (empire, papacy, secular states).  
- **Limitations**: single-author survey from mid-20th-century perspective; consult recent syntheses for newer interpretive trends.

## Provenance and condition

- Paperback with noticeable edge wear; hand-written mark on cover (“946.1”) likely an old shelving/call mark or price.
