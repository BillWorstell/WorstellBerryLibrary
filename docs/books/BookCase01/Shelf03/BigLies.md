**Summary:**

Joe Conason’s *Big Lies* is a fierce rebuttal to the conservative narratives that dominated American political discourse in the early 2000s. Drawing on the style and firepower of a seasoned journalist, Conason counters the mythology propagated by right-wing pundits, politicians, and think tanks, especially those associated with the Bush administration and its supporters. The book offers a chapter-by-chapter demolition of claims regarding liberal elites, media bias, and supposed conservative moral superiority, while also delving into hot-button issues like war, civil liberties, and economic inequality.

With chapters titled "Male Cheerleaders and Chicken Hawks" and "Faith, Charity, and the Mayberry Machiavellis," Conason takes a no-holds-barred approach, using wit, documented contradictions, and historical context to puncture the façade of conservative rhetoric. It's both a polemic and a media critique, written at a moment when liberal voices were scrambling to regain footing in the face of Fox News dominance and post-9/11 nationalism.

*Big Lies* may not convert the already-convinced, but it offers ammunition for critics of conservative politics and serves as a vivid snapshot of the early 2000s culture war in full flame.
