Michael Lind’s *The Next American Nation* is a sweeping, provocative vision of the United States in transformation. He argues that American history can be understood through a sequence of republics, each defined by a distinct national identity. Lind critiques the “multicultural” Third Republic, condemning what he sees as the corrosive effects of identity politics and racial preferences. In its place, he proposes a revitalized “Fourth Republic” based on liberal nationalism, economic equity, and civic integration.

Ambitious in scope and often polemical in tone, the book tackles topics from immigration and race to class structure and educational reform, grounded in a revisionist reading of American history. Whether or not one agrees with his prescriptions, Lind’s attempt to redraw the ideological map of American politics makes this a vital contribution to the political discourse of the 1990s and beyond.
