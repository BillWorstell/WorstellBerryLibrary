**Bushisms: The First Term, In His Own Special Words**
Edited by Jacob Weisberg
Fireside (Simon & Schuster), 2004

This "Post-Deluxe Election-Edition" collects and celebrates the most memorable verbal misfires of President George W. Bush's first term. Assembled by Slate editor Jacob Weisberg, this volume preserves the president's most famously mangled syntax and offbeat phrasing, turning them into a form of political folk art. The book includes more than twenty themed chapters, such as "Accidental Wit," "Presidential Education," and "Bad for Your Health," with a foreword by the late Molly Ivins and a new "reality-check feature" that helps place Bush’s remarks in context—or at least tries to.

For readers who followed Bush’s presidency with a mix of incredulity and fascination, this compendium offers a humorous, sometimes sobering reminder of how language shaped public perception of leadership in the early 2000s. Weisberg's light editorial hand and the book's bite-sized format make it a brisk and entertaining read.
