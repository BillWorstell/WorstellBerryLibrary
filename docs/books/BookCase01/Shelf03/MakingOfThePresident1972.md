## Why you should read this book

* **Capstone to a defining series.** White’s 1960–1972 cycle helped invent modern narrative political journalism; this volume shows his method fully formed in the TV-age campaign.
* **A front-row seat to realignment.** 1972 reveals post-New Deal shifts—Sunbelt growth, suburban voting, the “silent majority,” and fractures in the Democratic coalition.
* **Campaign craft, demystified.** From precinct organization and polling to the press relationship, it reads like a field manual whose tactics still echo today.
* **Crisis as it unfolds.** Contemporary chapters on **Eagleton**, **press vs. presidency**, and **Watergate** capture the scandal in motion—useful for understanding how narratives harden before facts are complete.
* **Data in context.** Maps and number-heavy chapters situate anecdotes in the Electoral College math—great alongside modern election analytics.
