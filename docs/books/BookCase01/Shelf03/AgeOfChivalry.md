# The Age of Chivalry — National Geographic Society

*“A volume in the Story of Man Library.”*  
![](AgeOfChivalry_Cover.jpg)

## Why read this
A richly illustrated, accessible survey of the European Middle Ages, this National Geographic volume moves from the **dawn of the Middle Ages** through the worlds of **Charlemagne**, **William the Conqueror**, **Bernard of Clairvaux**, **Richard the Lionheart**, and **Jacques Cœur**. It’s a visually guided introduction ideal for general readers curious about castles, cathedrals, crusading, monastic life, and medieval commerce.

## What it’s about (concise overview)
Organized as a sequence of thematic “worlds,” the book blends narrative chapters with short features, maps, and image essays. Scholarly voices (special essays by **T. S. R. Boase** and **Urban T. Holmes**) complement the magazine-style presentation overseen by editorial consultant **Kenneth M. Setton**. Topics range from Viking seaways and Norman conquest to cloister life, Gothic building, pilgrimage, crusading routes, and late-medieval trade. The result is a broad, readable panorama of medieval Europe, circa 5th–15th centuries.

## Author & perspective
Prepared by the **National Geographic Book Service** with scholarly guidance (Setton; essays by Boase and Holmes) and a foreword by **Melville Bell Grosvenor**. The treatment is synthesis and survey rather than monograph, written for a general audience in the late-1960s National Geographic house style. Expect emphasis on monuments, leaders, and routes, balanced by sidebars on everyday life; some interpretations reflect mid-20th-century mainstream views of the Middle Ages.

## UDC subject classification (for search)

- **Secondary:** `355` — Military affairs (chivalry, crusades); `271` — Monastic orders  
- **Tags:** medieval • crusades • cathedrals • monasticism • Europe
