## Description

Born of a meme and raised on feminist reverence, *Notorious RBG* celebrates the unlikely pop icon status of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Authors Irin Carmon and Shana Knizhnik pair legal insight with millennial-inflected adoration, profiling Ginsburg’s trailblazing career and personal resilience with both scholarly respect and affectionate irreverence.

The book balances substance and style, mixing biographical chapters with annotated dissents, fan tributes, recipes, and even a tongue-in-cheek guide to living like RBG. For readers looking to understand how a reserved legal mind became a Tumblr sensation—and what that says about American culture and justice—this book is a playful yet pointed tribute to legacy, gender equity, and dissent done right.
