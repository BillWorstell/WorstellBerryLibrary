## Why you should read this book

* **All-hazards readiness**: Clear, field-tested techniques for water, shelter, fire, signaling, and wayfinding across **desert, tropical, arctic, sea** and temperate environments.
* **Skill over gear**: Emphasizes methods you can execute with minimal or improvised tools—useful for backcountry travel, disaster prep, or teaching bushcraft.
* **Cross-disciplinary value**: Blends **first aid**, **botany (wild foods)**, **meteorology (cloud reading)**, and **navigation**—great for Scouts, outdoor programs, and field researchers.
* **Analog resilience**: A durable reference when power, GPS, or networks are down; ideal to pair with your practical drills binders.
* **Teach-able modules**: Each chapter aligns with class-length lessons (e.g., water procurement lab; knots practicum; edible plants ID walk).
* **Complements your library**: Pairs well with exploration journals (e.g., Cook/Ledyard) and primary sources on human endurance and adaptation.
