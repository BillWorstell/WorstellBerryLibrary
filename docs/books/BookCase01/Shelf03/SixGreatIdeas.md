## Why you should read this book (restored)
- **A gateway to the Great Conversation.** Adler distills the core ideas behind the Great Books/Syntopicon project into six approachable dialogues.  
- **Civic literacy in one sitting per theme.** Truth, Beauty, Goodness, Liberty, Equality, and Justice are the bedrock questions in classrooms, courts, galleries, and public life.  
- **Perfect for guided discussion.** The transcript format is modular: ideal for seminars, PTO/teacher nights, and your Truth-in-Translation teaching kits (pair an episode with short passages from Plato, Aquinas, Hume, Kant, Mill, or Rawls).  
- **Bridges scholarship and everyday life.** Moyers’ interviewing makes the abstractions practical—policy, media literacy, and moral reasoning all show up in plain language.  
- **Reusable across your projects.** Each episode maps cleanly onto your multi-reading-level materials (Simple/Layman/Learned) and can anchor lesson sequences or annotated readers.
