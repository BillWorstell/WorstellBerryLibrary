## Why You Should Read This Book

John Silber, longtime president of Boston University and a fierce voice in American education and political life, did not shy away from conflict. In *Straight Shooting*, he delivers a pointed critique of what he saw as moral relativism, academic decline, and political timidity—drawing on his career as educator, administrator, and sometimes combative public figure. The essays collected here range widely, touching on pedagogy, justice, geopolitics, and the fraying civic fabric of the late 20th century.

Readers interested in the intersection of education, ethics, and governance will find Silber’s unapologetically principled arguments thought-provoking—whether they agree with him or not. His prose is vigorous, his opinions unsparing, and his positions often controversial. The volume is both a window into one man’s formidable worldview and a challenge to contemporary complacency. Even for those who reject his conclusions, the sharpness of his analysis rewards engagement.
