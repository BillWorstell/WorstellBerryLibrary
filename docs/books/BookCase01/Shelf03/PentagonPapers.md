## Why you should read this book

* **Primary-source window into policy:** This volume condenses the Defense Department’s classified study of U.S. decision-making in Vietnam (1945–1967). You’re reading internal memos, estimates, and chronologies that reveal how strategy was formed—often at odds with public statements.
* **Landmark in press freedom:** Its publication sparked *New York Times Co. v. United States* (1971), the Supreme Court case that set the modern high bar against prior restraint, shaping American journalism and whistleblowing norms.
* **Civic literacy & historical method:** Side-by-side editorial framing and documentary evidence model how to interrogate sources, compare claims, and trace bureaucratic reasoning—skills directly transferable to studying later conflicts and policy debates.
* **Context for the Vietnam era:** The chapter sequence maps turning points (Tonkin Gulf, escalation, Tet) and the evolving roles of presidents, Pentagon leadership, and intelligence assessments.
