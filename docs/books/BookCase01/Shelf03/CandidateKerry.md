Published in 2004, *The Candidate* by Paul Alexander offers a behind-the-scenes chronicle of Senator John Kerry’s ultimately unsuccessful but fiercely fought campaign for the presidency. With a journalist’s eye for momentum and misstep, Alexander documents Kerry’s trajectory from war hero to Democratic frontrunner to the party’s 2004 nominee.

The book provides an insider’s view of campaign strategy, message control, media framing, and political miscalculations. Chapters with titles like "Mission Accomplished!" and "Bring It On!" anchor Kerry’s journey within the larger context of the Iraq War and George W. Bush’s first term. Alexander highlights Kerry’s victories in Iowa and New Hampshire and devotes attention to his campaign's secret weapon—his wife Teresa Heinz Kerry.

While *The Candidate* is steeped in the details of a single election cycle, its portrayal of campaign mechanics, candidate branding, and media spectacle makes it a useful postmortem of modern presidential politics. It captures a particular moment in time—one filled with post-9/11 anxieties, foreign policy friction, and red-versus-blue divides—that remains relevant for students of American political history.
