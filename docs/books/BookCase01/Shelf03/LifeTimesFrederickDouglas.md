Here’s an updated **`LifeTimesFrederickDouglas.md`** that restores the two sections you asked for (“Why you should read this book” and “UDC classifications”) while keeping the Shelf01 house-style. You can paste this straight into your repo (BookCase01/Shelf03). I kept punctuation ASCII-clean to dodge mojibake.

## Why you should read this book

* **A first-person account with national scope.** Douglass moves from enslaved child to public intellectual and statesman; his late-career perspective connects plantation slavery, antislavery strategy, the Civil War, and Reconstruction in one narrative arc.
* **Primary source for emancipation politics.** The book documents abolitionist networks, Black organizing, and policy debates (e.g., Black enlistment, citizenship, suffrage) in the author’s own words.
* **Rhetoric and media savvy.** Douglass shows how speeches, newspapers, and lecture tours were used to build a mass movement, making the volume a case study in advocacy and civic communication.
* **Continuing relevance.** Themes of citizenship, rights, policing of Black mobility, and the uses of history for democratic reform remain central to public life today.

---

## Research and teaching uses

* **African American history and political thought:** slavery, resistance, abolition, Reconstruction.
* **Media history:** antislavery press, lecture circuits, transatlantic public sphere.
* **Narrative studies:** autobiography, testimony, and memory as historical evidence.
* **Local history tie-ins:** chapters name people and places that can be mapped to regional archives and newspapers.

## UDC classifications (suggested)

Use or adapt to your local UDC edition; combine with auxiliaries for place and time as needed.

* **Primary:** `929 Douglass, Frederick (1818–1895)` — Biography and related studies.
* **History facet (common auxiliary of place and time):** `94(73)"18"` — United States history, 19th century. `(73)` is the UDC place auxiliary for the USA (see example usage in UDC literature: `821.111(73)`), and `"18"` is the auxiliary for the 19th century. ([IFLA Archive][1])
* **Topical facet (optional, for subject approach):** `326` — Slavery and emancipation; combine as needed with place/time, e.g., `326(73)"18"`. *(Note: wording and granularity vary by UDC edition, but 3xx social sciences and 326 for slavery/emancipation are standard in practice.)*

> Notes on syntax: parentheses denote **place** auxiliaries; quoted numerals denote **time** auxiliaries; numbers can be combined additively for complex subjects. For overviews of UDC common auxiliaries and combination syntax, see the UDC summary and outline. ([Wikipedia][2])
