## Why you should read this book
- **Anatomy of a policy failure.** Skocpol’s inside–outside account of the 1993–94 Clinton health-security drive remains one of the clearest case studies of how design choices, interest-group pushback, media framing, and institutional veto points can sink major reform in the U.S. system.  
- **Concepts you can reuse.** Coalition-building, policy feedback, “policy design as politics,” and the limits of task-force style legislating—ideas that travel well beyond health care.  
- **A snapshot of a turning point.** The book traces how the backlash helped power a wider **turn against government** in the 1990s, shaping party coalitions and rhetoric that still echo in contemporary debates.  
- **Readable political sociology.** Combines archival detail with accessible narrative—useful for students of public policy, political science, health administration, and recent U.S. history.
