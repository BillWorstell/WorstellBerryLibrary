## Why you should read this book

Ledyard was the **first notable American** to sail with Cook and then to attempt an audacious solo traverse of **Russia and Siberia** to rejoin the expedition by land. His journals and letters capture the third voyage from the viewpoint of a hands-on seaman rather than an officer, mixing observation, rumor, and raw experience.
James Zug’s edition assembles **the complete surviving writings** into a single, navigable volume—Cook’s last voyage journal, the European and Siberian letters, and the Egyptian diary that ends just before Ledyard’s death. For family/local-history projects and courses on discovery, empire, or the Enlightenment, it’s a **primary source** that shows how information, commodities, and people moved through the late-18th-century Atlantic/Pacific worlds, and how an American voice interpreted Cook.
