Here’s a ready-to-drop-in **VaultsOfMemory.md** that follows the same “Card Catalog” house style as your Shelf01 entries and the AgeOfChivalry card you approved.
(It assumes the four JPGs sit in the **same folder** as this `.md`. If you keep images in a subfolder, just prefix the filenames accordingly.)
