# Dangerous Thoughts: Memoirs of a Russian Life

**Yuri Orlov** — translated by **Thomas P. Whitney** (William Morrow, 1991)

## Why read it

A landmark memoir by one of the founders of the Moscow Helsinki Group, *Dangerous Thoughts* takes you inside the Soviet dissident movement—arrests, labor camp, internal exile—and shows how a theoretical physicist became a world-known voice for human rights.

## What’s inside (concise contents & themes)

* Early life and scientific training in the USSR
* The growth of dissent; forming the Moscow Helsinki Group (1976)
* Arrest (1977), trial, labor-camp years, internal exile
* Release and deportation to the U.S. (1986)
* Return to physics and continued advocacy
* Reflections on conscience, truth, and the moral costs of authoritarianism

> Owner’s note: The catalog owner collaborated with Orlov at Brookhaven National Laboratory in the 1990s on the Muon g-2 experiment; he remembers Orlov as kind and quietly profound. That lived connection makes this copy a special piece of the collection.

## Author, perspective, time, purpose

* **Author:** Yuri F. Orlov (1924–2020), Soviet/Russian physicist and human-rights activist; prisoner of conscience; later a physicist in the U.S.
* **Perspective:** First-person narrative—scientist’s eye for detail plus moral philosophy; unapologetically dissident.
* **Time covered:** ca. 1930s–late 1980s, with emphasis on 1970s–1986.
* **Purpose:** To bear witness to repression and to argue for universal human rights and freedom of thought.

## Reception & impact (brief)

Upon publication the book was widely cited in human-rights circles and academic reviews as a primary first-person source on the Soviet dissident movement. It complemented works by Sakharov and others, adding a physicist-organizer’s view of the Helsinki network. The English translation by Whitney (a noted translator of Russian memoirs) helped it reach a broad readership in the West.

## Scope & style

* **Scope:** Political memoir intersecting with scientific life; camp and exile narratives; émigré adaptation.
* **Style:** Clear, restrained, analytic; moral reflection rather than sensationalism; occasional technical/scientific asides.

## Publication & intended readership

* **Edition:** First U.S. edition (1991), William Morrow (New York); hardcover.
* **Readership:** Readers of Cold-War history, human-rights studies, Russian studies, political science, and history of science; general audiences seeking a lucid dissident memoir.

## Universal Decimal Classification (useful tags)

* **929 Orlov, Yuri** — Personal biography
* **94(47)"1970/1991"** — History of Russia/USSR, late Soviet period
* **323.2** — Civil & political rights; human rights; dissent
* **329.18** — (approx.) Political opposition/dissident movements
* **53(092) Orlov** — Physicists, biographies (optional secondary facet)

*(UDC facets combined as needed, e.g., 929 Orlov + 94(47)"1970/1991" + 323.2.)*
