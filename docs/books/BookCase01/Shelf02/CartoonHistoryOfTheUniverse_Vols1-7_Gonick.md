## Why read this

A brilliant, cheeky crash course in world history—told in comics. Gonick turns empires, revolutions, religions, and scientific leaps into a page-turning narrative that’s actually fun, without dumbing things down.

## What it covers (concise)

This omnibus compiles the **first seven volumes** of *The Cartoon History of the Universe*, spanning prehistory through classical eras and late antiquity, with recurring sidebars on science, culture, and everyday life. It mixes annotated cartoons with clear exposition and maps.

> **Source note:** Verso page confirms: “*The Cartoon History of the Universe, volumes 1–7* … Includes bibliographical references” and lists ISBN 0-385-26520-4 (Doubleday, 1990).
