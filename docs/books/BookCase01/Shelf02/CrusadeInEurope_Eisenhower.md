**Subjects:** US History; WWII; Europe; Memoir; Military leadership

### Why read this

A first-person strategic view of the European Theater of Operations from the Allied Supreme Commander himself. If you want to understand how coalition warfare works at the very top—personalities, logistics, and strategy under pressure—this is one of the core primary sources.

### What it’s about (concise)

Eisenhower narrates the path from his 1942 assignment to lead Allied forces through North Africa and Italy to Operation OVERLORD, the Normandy landings, the breakout across France, the Battle of the Bulge, the Rhine crossing, and Germany’s surrender. The through-line is coalition command—balancing British and American views (and egos), managing scarce resources, and synchronizing air, sea, and land power across a vast theater.

### Reception & impact
