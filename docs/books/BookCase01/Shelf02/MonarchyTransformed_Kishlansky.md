# A Monarchy Transformed: Britain 1603–1714 — Mark Kishlansky

> A crisp, revisionist tour of the Stuart century—from the uneasy union under James I to the Hanoverian threshold—asking how a relatively poor composite monarchy generated revolution, republican experiment, restoration, and the “Glorious” re-settlement of 1688–89.

## What it’s about (concise)

Kishlansky surveys a century that reconfigured the British state: dynastic union, religious fractures, fiscal and constitutional crises, civil wars across multiple kingdoms, the regicide and Commonwealth, Restoration monarchy, and the Revolution Settlement. His through-line is political—how authority was contested, negotiated, and ultimately reframed—rather than a longue-durée social/economic account.

## Author, perspective & method

* **Mark Kishlansky (1953–2015)**, early modern British historian (Harvard).
* **Perspective:** Part of the “revisionist” wave—emphasizes short-term political choices, institutions, and the composite nature of the Stuart monarchies over deterministic social causes.
* **Sources/Approach:** Parliamentary records, state papers, printed polemic, and recent historiography, synthesized into a fast, thesis-driven narrative.

---

## Reception & impact (brief)

* **Reception:** Well regarded as the accessible political volume in the *Penguin History of Britain* series. Praised for clarity and argumentation; sometimes critiqued by social/Whig-leaning readers for giving less weight to long-run socio-economic drivers.
* **Use today:** A compact orientation text for students and general readers before diving into specialized studies of Civil War, Restoration politics, or the 1688–89 settlement.

---

## Scope & style

* **Scope:** High-level political narrative with targeted forays into religion, war, finance, and the “three kingdoms” framework (England, Scotland, Ireland).
* **Style:** Concise chapters; argument-forward prose; light scholarly apparatus in trade format.

---

## Intended readership & publication type

* **Readership:** General readers, undergraduates, and researchers needing a one-volume survey of 1603–1714.
* **Type:** Trade history / scholarly synthesis in a mainstream series.
