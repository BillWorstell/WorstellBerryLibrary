## 1) Why read this?

Tuchman turns the **14th century**—plague, war, revolt, and religious crisis—into a riveting panorama anchored in the life of **Enguerrand de Coucy VII**. If you like history that reads like an epic novel but rests on serious scholarship, this is one of the 20th century’s landmark works of narrative history.

## 2) What it’s about (concise)

A sweeping account of Western Europe c. 1300–1400 told through politics, war (the **Hundred Years’ War**), the **Black Death**, church schism, and everyday life. By following one great French noble’s world, Tuchman shows how people imagined order—and how it unraveled.

## 4) Author, perspective, time, purpose

* **Author:** *Barbara W. Tuchman* (1912–1989), Pulitzer Prize-winning popular historian.
* **Perspective:** Narrative synthesis shaped by primary chronicles and modern historians; foregrounds France/England; stresses contingency, character, and culture over quantitative economic history.
* **Time of writing:** Late 1970s—post-*Guns of August*; reflects that era’s sources and emphases.
* **Purpose:** To interpret the 14th century as a “mirror” for modern crisis and to humanize medieval Europe via one family’s orbit.

## 5) Reception & impact (brief)

A commercial and critical success on publication; widely assigned in college courses. Praised for storytelling and breadth; some specialists note limits typical of narrative synthesis (e.g., less economic/peasant data than newer monographs). Still a **gateway classic** to late-medieval Europe.

## 6) Scope & style

* **Scope:** Western Europe (esp. France/England), c. 1300–1400; politics, war, plague, church, social life, culture.
* **Style:** Vivid, scene-driven chapters; long narrative arcs with carefully curated quotations.

## 7) Publication & audience

* **Type:** Trade **hardcover** (your copy); likely **Knopf, New York, 1978** (please confirm on verso).
* **Audience:** General readers; undergrads; anyone interested in medieval history told with literary verve.
