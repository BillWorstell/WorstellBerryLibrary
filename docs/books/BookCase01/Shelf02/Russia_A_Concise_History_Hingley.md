### Why you might want to read this

A swift, highly readable tour through a thousand years of Russian history—from Kievan Rus’ to the late-Soviet era—by a veteran Oxford scholar. If you want the big arcs (dynasties, reforms, revolutions, rulers) without wading into a multi-volume epic, this is the concise map.

### What it covers (concise description)

Hingley sketches Russia’s political and cultural development across five eras: the pre-imperial roots, the Romanov empire’s expansion and reform, the 1917 collapse, the short-lived Provisional Government, and the Soviet experiment through its late-20th-century crises. Sidebars (dynastic tables) and a short bibliography make it a handy overview and refresher.
