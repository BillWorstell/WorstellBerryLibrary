# The Ultra Secret (1974) — F. W. Winterbotham

**Shelf ID:** BC01-S02-013
**Copy:** Harper & Row hardback (ISBN 0-06-014678-8). LoC card 74-7826.

## Why read this

The book that blew the lid off “Ultra.” Winterbotham’s insider account was the **first public revelation** that the Allies were reading high-level encrypted German traffic during WWII. If you enjoy intelligence history, Enigma, or the hidden levers behind battlefield outcomes, this is the doorway text.

## What it’s about (concise)

* How the British broke **Enigma** and built a secret system—**ULTRA**—to distribute intelligence without exposing the source.
* Vignettes showing Ultra’s influence on campaigns in North Africa, the Atlantic, and Europe.
* The machinery of secrecy: compartmentalization, cover stories, and the politics of who got to see what.

*Table of contents:* not visible in the images. Expect chapters moving from pre-war setup and Bletchley Park operations to case studies of Ultra at sea and on land, concluding with post-war secrecy.

## Author, perspective, time, purpose

* **Author:** Air Commodore **F. W. Winterbotham**, RAF (Head of Air Section, MI6; liaison for Ultra distribution).
* **Perspective:** Senior liaison/consumer of Ultra, not a cryptanalyst; emphasizes operational use and high-level handling rather than machine-room detail.
* **Time & purpose:** Written ~30 years after the war when secrecy constraints eased; aims to **disclose** the existence and value of Ultra and to argue for its decisive impact.

## Reception, impact, and later assessment

* **Impact (1974):** Sensational. It reframed popular understanding of WWII by introducing Ultra into the story, prompting a wave of scholarship.
* **Critiques:** Later historians (and veterans) praised the revelation but noted **errors/overstatements** and gaps in technical detail; subsequent works (e.g., Hinsley’s official history; Ralph Bennett; David Kahn) refined or corrected parts of the narrative.
* **Legacy:** Still a landmark for opening the subject, even if not the last word.

## Scope & style

* **Scope:** From the birth of Ultra to selected campaigns (air war, Atlantic convoys, North Africa, Normandy context).
* **Style:** Memoir-history hybrid; accessible, anecdotal, occasionally polemical; light on mathematics and deep cryptologic method.

## Publication & readership

* **Type:** Narrative military/intelligence history (memoir-informed).
* **Anticipated readers:** General readers of WWII history, intelligence studies, policy/strategy audiences, and students needing the “origin” account of Ultra’s public story.
