## Israel: A History — Martin Gilbert (Harper Perennial, 2008)

### Why this book is worth your time

* A sweeping, single-volume narrative of Israel from its late-19th-century origins through the modern state.
* Written by Sir Martin Gilbert, famed narrative historian and Churchill’s official biographer.
* Balances battlefield, diplomacy, and everyday nation-building (immigration, institutions, culture).

### What it’s about (quick take)

Gilbert traces the making of the State of Israel: the rise of political Zionism; diplomacy under the British Mandate; war and statehood in 1948; mass immigration and institution-building; successive Arab–Israeli wars; peace efforts and intifadas; and the social, religious, and political debates inside Israeli society. The emphasis is on people and documents—cabinets, soldiers, settlers, and diplomats—woven into an accessible chronological story.
