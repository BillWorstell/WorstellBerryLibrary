> **Why read it?**  
> A sweeping, story-driven tour of the late-18th/early-19th-century “second scientific revolution,” when poets, astronomers, chemists, surgeons, sailors, and balloonists all chased the sublime. Holmes shows how curiosity, risk, and imagination remade science—and culture.

## What it’s about (concise)
Holmes narrates how a cohort of Romantics—Joseph Banks (voyaging and the Royal Society), William & Caroline Herschel (deep-sky astronomy), Humphry Davy (chemistry, electrochemistry), Michael Faraday (apprenticeship and experiment), Mungo Park (exploration), balloonists and early aeronauts—expanded the boundaries of the known world. The book pairs breakthrough experiments with the era’s poetry, art, and public spectacle, arguing that science and the Romantic imagination were mutually reinforcing.
