## Why read it

Short, richly illustrated, and written by one of the most influential excavators of the ancient Near East, this booklet is the most approachable single-sitting introduction to the famed carved ivories unearthed at **Nimrud** (ancient Kalhu) — objects that changed how scholars understand luxury craft, courtly taste, and cultural exchange across Assyria, Phoenicia, and the Levant.

---

## What it’s about (concise description)

Mallowan surveys the discovery, stylistic features, and likely provenance of the **Nimrud ivories** recovered from Assyrian palace contexts. Organized by style families (Assyrian, Phoenician, “Samarian”), the book pairs brief commentary with images, museum numbers, and a compact bibliography, giving readers a field archaeologist’s orientation to form, iconography, and workmanship.

## Author, perspective, time, purpose

**Sir Max Mallowan** (1904–1978) was a leading field archaeologist (Ur, Nineveh, Nimrud; later Director, British School of Archaeology in Iraq). His perspective here is curatorial-archaeological: to offer a clear, image-led guide that sorts the ivories by recognisable formal features and likely cultural origins. The tone is concise and authoritative, aimed at museum visitors and students who need orientation rather than exhaustive catalogue raisonné detail.

---

## Reception & impact (brief)

For decades this booklet functioned as the go-to **introductory** survey for the Nimrud material — frequently cited in course syllabi and museum guides. Later technical catalogues and scientific studies superseded aspects of attribution and dating, but Mallowan’s style groupings and clean visual presentation still make this an efficient first stop for non-specialists.

---

## Scope & style

* **Scope:** the core British Museum holdings; limited narrative; focus on typology, motifs, and workmanship.

---
