# The Cartoon History of the Modern World, Part 1  
**Larry Gonick** — HarperCollins, New York, 2007 (First edition, PB)  
*Shelf code:* BC01-S02-017

## 1) Why read this?
A zippy, irreverent tour from the Age of Exploration to the framing of the U.S. Constitution—told in panels that actually teach. If you like learning big sweeps of history without slog, this is catnip.

## 2) What’s inside (concise)
A graphic narrative of early modern world history, emphasizing Europe’s expansion, the Columbian exchange, religious upheavals, scientific and political revolutions, and the birth of the United States. Humor and cartoons carry the facts; footnotes and side gags reward careful readers.
