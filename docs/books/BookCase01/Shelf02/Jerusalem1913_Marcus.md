### Jerusalem 1913 — The Origins of the Arab–Israeli Conflict

*Amy Dockser Marcus (Penguin Books, 2008 paperback; orig. Viking, 2007)*

#### Why read this

A tightly told pre-WWI story that shows how tensions in late Ottoman Palestine were already hardening into the Arab–Zionist conflict we know today. Marcus follows a small cast of Ottoman officials, Arab intellectuals, Zionist organizers, and European diplomats whose choices and misreadings in 1913 foreshadowed the shattering changes of 1914–18.

#### What it’s about (concise)

Journalist-historian Amy Dockser Marcus reconstructs Jerusalem and Ottoman Palestine on the eve of World War I—Young Turk politics, Zionist land purchase and settlement, Arab civic awakening, and European power maneuvering. Through letters, press accounts, and archives, she argues that by 1913 positions had crystallized and opportunities for accommodation were narrowing, setting the stage for conflict after the Ottoman collapse.
