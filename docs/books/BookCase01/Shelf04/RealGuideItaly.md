## Overview

**The Real Guide: Italy** delivers what its subtitle promises: independent, adventurous, opinionated travel. Compiled by a well-traveled editorial team with deep ties to Italy and a strong editorial backbone, this guide was part of a series known for its cultural insights and on-the-ground honesty.
