## Overview

A classic student-produced guidebook that shaped generations of backpackers’ travel across Italy, Malta, and Tunisia. Part of the larger “Let’s Go” series from Harvard Student Agencies, *Let’s Go: Italy 1989* reflects the energetic, no-nonsense, budget-conscious approach to travel that defined late 20th-century guidebooks. Created and edited by students, its blend of frugal tips, on-the-ground reporting, and sometimes cheeky commentary offered an accessible counterpoint to more formal travel guides.

## Significance

*Let’s Go: Italy 1989* was a cultural artifact of its time—pre-internet, heavy on personal experience and word-of-mouth. This edition stood out for its:

- Coverage of lesser-known locales, from Sardinian villages to inland Tunisian oases.
- Affordable travel hacks for students and backpackers.
- Candid tone that helped redefine guidebook voice—witty, irreverent, personal.
- Historical value for understanding how students viewed Italy (and the Mediterranean) in the 1980s.
