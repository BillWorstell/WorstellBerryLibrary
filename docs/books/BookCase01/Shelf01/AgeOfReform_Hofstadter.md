# The Age of Reform — Richard Hofstadter (1955)

### Why read this
A single, elegant volume that tries to explain **how three reform surges—Populism, Progressivism, and the New Deal—fit together**. Even when you disagree, Hofstadter gives you a sharp framework for thinking about American politics from the 1890s to World War II.

### What it’s about (concise overview)
Hofstadter links farm Populism of the 1890s, middle-class Progressivism of the early 1900s, and the crisis politics of the 1930s. He argues these movements were shaped by **status anxieties**, shifts in the economy, and nostalgia for a disappearing producer ethic. The book proceeds thematically—ideas, leaders, constituencies—while tracing how reform impulses moved from anti-monopoly agrarianism to technocratic national government.

### Author & perspective
Richard Hofstadter (1916–1970) was a leading mid-20th-century historian associated with the “consensus” school. Expect **interpretive essays** rather than archival case studies: broad synthesis, psychological motives, and political culture. His portraits—of Bryan, Roosevelt, the muckrakers, the Brandeis–Wilson tradition, FDR—are memorable and provocative. Later scholars have revised parts of his thesis (especially on Populism and class/race), but the frame remains a touchstone.

### Reception & impact
Instantly influential; **awarded the 1956 Pulitzer Prize in History**. The book shaped how generations taught and argued about reform politics. It also sparked significant debate—critiques of the “status anxiety” model and calls to foreground labor, race, and regional diversity. Reading it today doubles as a lesson in historiography.
