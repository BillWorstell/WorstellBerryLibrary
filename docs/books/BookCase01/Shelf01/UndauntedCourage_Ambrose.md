# *Undaunted Courage* — Stephen E. Ambrose

### Why read this
A gripping, scene-by-scene account of the **Lewis & Clark Expedition**, told with Ambrose’s trademark narrative drive.

### What it’s about (concise overview)
Ambrose follows **Meriwether Lewis** from his apprenticeship with **Thomas Jefferson** through the 1804–06 journey to the Pacific and back. The book integrates **political background** (the **Louisiana Purchase**), **indigenous diplomacy**, **geography & natural history**, and the partnership with **William Clark**, highlighting the triumphs and costs of the expedition and Lewis’s troubled final years. This paperback includes the author’s **2002 bicentennial introduction**.
