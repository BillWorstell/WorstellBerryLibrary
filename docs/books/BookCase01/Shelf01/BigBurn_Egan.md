# The Big Burn — Timothy Egan (2010, Mariner Books)

### Why read this
An edge-of-your-seat account of the **Great Fire of 1910** that roared across Idaho and Montana—and the political struggle that birthed American conservation. If you want one book that explains how wildland fire, the **U.S. Forest Service**, **Gifford Pinchot**, and **Theodore Roosevelt** intersect, this is it.

### What it’s about (concise overview)
Egan braids two stories: the young Forest Service fighting for survival in Washington, and the dry summer that set up a perfect storm in the Northern Rockies. When hurricane-force winds arrive, thousands of firefighters—immigrants, townspeople, soldiers—face firestorms that erase entire communities. The aftermath cements national support for the Forest Service and the idea of **public lands**. The book doubles as a primer on early wildfire policy, conservation politics, and the human costs of both.

### Table of contents (if readily available)
TBD

### Author & perspective
Pulitzer-winning journalist **Timothy Egan** writes narrative history with strong scene work and crisp context. His perspective is sympathetic to TR and Pinchot’s conservation project while attentive to class, labor, and the West’s boomtown realities. Expect tight chapters, vivid profiles, and a reporter’s eye for detail.

### Reception & impact
