# The Big Burn — Timothy Egan  
*Theodore Roosevelt & the Fire That Saved America*

![Cover — The Big Burn](BigBurn_Egan_Cover.jpg)

## Why read this
A gripping narrative of the **Great Fire of 1910** in Idaho and Montana—and the political fight that forged American conservation. Egan ties wildfire, **Theodore Roosevelt**, **Gifford Pinchot**, and the early **U.S. Forest Service** into one page-turner of disaster and reform.

## What it’s about (concise overview)
Two threads drive the book: the Forest Service’s struggle to survive in Washington, and the bone-dry summer that set the Northern Rockies ablaze. When hurricane-force winds arrive, towns and crews face firestorms; the aftermath reshapes federal wildfire policy and the idea of **public land**.
