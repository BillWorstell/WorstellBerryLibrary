# *The River of Doubt* — Candice Millard  
*(First Anchor Books/Broadway Books edition, 2006; ©2005)*

![Cover — *The River of Doubt*](RiverOfDoubt_Millard_Cover.jpg)

## Why read this
Weeks after losing his third-party presidential run, Theodore Roosevelt plunged into Brazil’s unmapped interior with Cândido Rondon, his son Kermit, and a lean party of paddlers and scientists. The descent of the **Rio da Dúvida** nearly killed him. This is gripping survival nonfiction that doubles as a study in leadership under extreme stress.

## What it’s about (concise overview)
Millard reconstructs the 1913–14 expedition down a then-unknown Amazon tributary: rapids, disease, starvation, and mutiny risk turned a mapping mission into a fight to live. The book balances scene-driven narrative with context (Indigenous territories, rubber economy, early 20th-century science) and follows the afterlives of Roosevelt, Rondon, and the river that now bears Roosevelt’s name.

## Author & perspective
Candice Millard writes narrative history with a reporter’s sense for scene and momentum. Her treatment is sympathetic to Roosevelt but gives full due to **Cândido Rondon** and Brazilian leadership/ethics. The perspective blends adventure writing with cultural and environmental context.
