# The River of Doubt — Candice Millard (2006 pbk.)

### Why read this
Weeks after losing his third-party run for the presidency, Theodore Roosevelt set off into Brazil’s unmapped interior with his son Kermit and a small party of Brazilian officers and paddlers. The journey nearly killed him. This is **gripping survival nonfiction** that doubles as character study—stubborn courage, bad luck, and hard choices in a lethal place.

### What it’s about (concise overview)
Millard reconstructs the 1913–14 expedition down the **Rio da Dúvida** (later the Roosevelt River), where rapids, disease, and scarcity turned a scientific mapping mission into a fight to live. The narrative follows three tracks: the river’s geography and ecology; the expedition’s logistics and leadership conflicts (Roosevelt, Rondon, Kermit, Cherrie); and the unraveling health and morale that pushed TR to the edge. A closing section traces aftermaths—naming the river, controversies over the route, and Roosevelt’s long recovery.

### Table of contents (if readily available)

### Author & perspective
Candice Millard writes narrative history with a reporter’s eye for scene and pacing. Her perspective is sympathetic to Roosevelt while attentive to Brazilian leadership—especially **Cândido Rondon**, whose discipline and ethics anchor the party. The book balances adventure with context: Indigenous territories, rubber economics, and early-20th-century scientific exploration.

### Reception & impact
