# *The Worst Hard Time* — Timothy Egan
*(The Untold Story of Those Who Survived the Great American Dust Bowl — Mariner Books/First Mariner Books ed., 2006)*

[![Cover — *The Worst Hard Time*](WorstHardTime_Egan_Cover.jpg)](WorstHardTime_Egan_Cover.jpg)

## Why read this
If you want to know what the **Great Depression** felt like on the High Plains, this is the human story—neighbors, towns, and families who endured the **Dust Bowl** from the inside. It’s vivid narrative history that makes climate, economics, and policy choices legible through lived experience.

## What it’s about (concise overview)
Egan follows Great Plains communities (Texas/Oklahoma Panhandle, Colorado, Kansas) through the **wheat boom**, land speculation and mechanized plowing, then the ecological collapse of the 1930s: black blizzards, dust pneumonia, foreclosure, and out‑migration. He weaves survivor testimony with science and policy, from homesteading laws and boosterism to the New Deal’s soil‑conservation response.
