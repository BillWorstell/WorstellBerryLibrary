# The Worst Hard Time — Timothy Egan (2006, Mariner Books)

### Why read this
If you want to know what the **Great Depression** felt like on the High Plains, this is the human story—neighbors, towns, and families who endured the **Dust Bowl** from the inside. It’s vivid narrative history that makes climate, economics, and policy choices legible through lived experience.

### What it’s about (concise overview)
Egan follows a cluster of Great Plains communities (Texas/Oklahoma Panhandle, Colorado, Kansas) through the **wheat boom**, land speculation and mechanized plowing, then the ecological collapse of the 1930s: black blizzards, dust pneumonia, foreclosure, and out-migration. He weaves survivor testimony with science and policy, from homesteading laws and boosterism to the New Deal’s soil-conservation response.

### Author & perspective
Journalist-historian **Timothy Egan** writes with a strong narrative drive and a clear explanatory thread. The perspective is empathetic to settlers while attentive to structural causes—federal land policy, commodity markets, and environmental mismanagement. Expect brisk chapters and memorable portraits.

### Reception & impact
