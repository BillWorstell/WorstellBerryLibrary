# Sacagawea of the Lewis & Clark Expedition — Ella E. Clark & Margot Edmonds (1979/1983)

### Why read this
Behind the names on maps and monuments is a young Shoshone woman whose presence shaped the Corps of Discovery. This book asks what we **really** know about Sacagawea—and how a person became a legend—by placing her within the expedition and then tracing the century of stories that followed.

### What it’s about (concise overview)
Clark and Edmonds combine narrative and documentary material to follow Sacagawea from her entry into the Lewis & Clark party through the journey to the Pacific and back. The first half presents the expedition episodes where she is clearly in the record—interpretation, recognition scenes, crisis moments, and the return. The second half is a historical inquiry into the **making of the legend**: conflicting testimonies, late recollections, reservation-era stories, and the afterlife of her image in American memory. The aim is careful sorting of **evidence vs. tradition**, offering readers both a biography and a guide to sources.

### Author & perspective
Ella E. Clark (folklorist/educator) and Margot Edmonds examine both **primary expedition sources** and later oral/printed traditions. Their perspective is evaluative: they present competing claims, identify where evidence is firm or thin, and avoid settling contested questions where records do not warrant it. Readers get an accessible synthesis with an emphasis on method—how historians know what they know.

### Reception & impact
