# *The Conspiracy of Pontiac* — Francis Parkman (Bison Books ed., Vol. 1)

## Why read this

Parkman’s classic narrative history of the 1763 Great Lakes–Ohio Valley uprising led by **Pontiac** reveals the messy transition from French to British rule after the Seven Years’ War: diplomacy, sieges (Detroit, Michilimackinac), and frontier entanglements among Native nations, the British Empire, and colonial settlers. It’s vivid, source-rich 19th-century storytelling that shaped generations of U.S. frontier history.

## What it’s about (concise overview)

Volume 1 traces the **background (1608–1763)**, the **transfer of forts (1760)**, the **formation of the confederacy (1760–1763)**, preparations for war, and the early campaign of **1763**—including **Pontiac’s siege of Detroit** and the **Michilimackinac** disaster—told through journals, official papers, and oral testimony. (Readers should also be aware of Parkman’s period biases and language when describing Native peoples.)
