# *The Cartoon History of the United States* — **Larry Gonick**

## Why read this
A lively, visual sweep of U.S. history by a veteran cartoonist–explainer. Great for quick refreshers, motivated teens, and adults who like learning via pictures without sacrificing factual backbone.

## What it's about (concise overview)
From England’s first footholds to the early 1990s, Gonick sketches politics, economics, social change, and everyday life in panels that mix jokes with clear explanations. This omnibus adapts and updates material from two earlier volumes (to 1865; 1865–now).
