# John Adams — David McCullough (2002)

### Why read this
David McCullough turns the life of the often-underappreciated second U.S. president into a gripping narrative of conviction, friendship, and nation-building. If you’re curious how independence became governance—and how imperfect people shouldered impossible tasks—this is a generous, humane doorway into the early republic.

### What it’s about (concise overview)
McCullough follows John Adams from his Massachusetts beginnings through the crisis years of the Revolution, his diplomatic service in France and the Netherlands, the embattled vice-presidency, a single hard-won term as president, and a reflective retirement in Quincy. The book foregrounds Adams’s partnership with Abigail, his rivalry and reconciliation with Thomas Jefferson, and the messy work of creating institutions from scratch. It’s narrative history with an eye for character: principled, stubborn, funny, and sometimes wrong—Adams emerges as indispensable to American independence and statecraft.

### Author & perspective
David McCullough (1933–2022) was a widely read American narrative historian and biographer.

In *John Adams* he leans toward sympathetic appraisal, but the portrait includes failures (e.g., the Alien and Sedition Acts) and personal blind spots. Expect a confident, accessible voice rather than academic argumentation.
