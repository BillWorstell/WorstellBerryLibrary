# *The Declaration of Independence* + *Selections from the Bible* (Great Books Foundation)

### Why read this
A slim, teachable pairing that sets America’s **founding statement of political purpose** beside two **biblical narratives of abuse of power and moral judgment**. It’s a conversation starter about **authority, rights, and accountability**—perfect for seminars, family reading, or curriculum use.

### What it’s about (concise overview)
The booklet prints the **Declaration of Independence (1776)** in full, then excerpts **1 Kings 21** (Naboth’s vineyard) and **2 Samuel 11–12** (David, Bathsheba, and Nathan’s rebuke). The juxtaposition invites readers to consider **natural rights**, **tyranny**, and **moral responsibility**—themes that informed early American political rhetoric.
