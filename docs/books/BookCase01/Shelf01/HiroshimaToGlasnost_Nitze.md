# *From Hiroshima to Glasnost* — **Paul H. Nitze**

*(At the Center of Decision — A Memoir)*

![Cover image](HiroshimaToGlasnost_Nitze_Cover.jpg)

## Why read this
An unparalleled first‑person account of U.S. national security decision‑making from WWII’s end through the late Cold War—from the Strategic Bombing Survey and NSC‑68, through the Cuban Missile Crisis, Vietnam, SALT I & II, INF, and beyond. Nitze’s vantage point as negotiator and policy architect makes this essential for understanding how doctrine, politics, and personalities shaped nuclear strategy and arms control.

## What it’s about (concise overview)
Nitze traces the evolution of American grand strategy and arms control across four decades. He recounts internal debates, negotiations with Soviet counterparts, and the interplay between presidential leadership, interagency process, and alliance politics. The narrative blends memo‑level detail with retrospective judgments about what produced stability—and what didn’t.

## Author & perspective
**Paul H. Nitze (1907–2004)** was a central architect of U.S. Cold War policy and later namesake of Johns Hopkins SAIS. Perspective: **participant‑observer**—analytic, sometimes blunt, often arguing for strength plus verifiable arms limits. Coauthors **Ann M. Smith** and **Steven L. Rearden** help stitch documents and memory into a clean narrative.
