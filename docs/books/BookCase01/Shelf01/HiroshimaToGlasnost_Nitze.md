# *From Hiroshima to Glasnost* — Paul H. Nitze  
*At the Center of Decision — A Memoir* (Grove Weidenfeld, 1989)

![Cover — From Hiroshima to Glasnost](HiroshimaToGlasnost_Nitze_Cover.jpg)

## Why read this
A front‑row account of U.S. strategy from the dawn of the nuclear age to the endgame of the Cold War. Nitze helped shape **NSC‑68**, served as **Secretary of the Navy** and **Deputy Secretary of Defense**, and later negotiated arms‑control deals. If you want to see how big choices were argued inside Washington, this is indispensable.

## What it’s about (concise overview)
Nitze narrates his career from WWII planning and the aftermath of **Hiroshima**, through containment strategy, the **Cuban Missile Crisis**, Vietnam‑era defense debates, détente, and the 1980s **INF** negotiations (including the “walk in the woods”). Through‑line: how the U.S. tried to balance deterrence, alliance management, and arms control while technology and geopolitics kept shifting.

Rearden** help stitch documents and memory into clear narrative.
