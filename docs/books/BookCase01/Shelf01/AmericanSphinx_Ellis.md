# American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas Jefferson — Joseph J. Ellis (1998)

### Why read this
Thomas Jefferson can feel remote: philosopher, revolutionary, slaveholder, president. Ellis cuts through the marble to ask a deceptively simple question—**what kind of person was Jefferson?** The result is a brisk, provocative portrait that invites admiration and discomfort in equal measure.

### What it’s about (concise overview)
Rather than a cradle-to-grave chronicle, this is a **character study** built around decisive moments: the Declaration, Paris and the ambassadorial years, the first party system, the presidency, and retirement at Monticello. Ellis emphasizes Jefferson’s idealism and rhetorical brilliance, his talent for avoiding open conflict, and the gap between universal principles and enslaved reality at home. The through-line is paradox: a statesman who distrusted power, a public visionary who practiced private compartmentalization, an optimist who presided over war fears and partisan rancor.

### Author & perspective
Joseph J. Ellis is a historian of the American founding known for accessible prose and close reading of correspondence. His stance here is **interpretive** more than documentary—he weighs testimony, context, and Jefferson’s own strategic silences to assess motives and temperament. The book neither prosecutes nor excuses; it frames Jefferson as a man of ideals and evasions, letting tensions stand where evidence is inconclusive.

### Reception & impact
A national bestseller and **winner of the National Book Award** (1997, hardcover), the book helped reignite popular debate about Jefferson’s contradictions and legacy. It has remained a widely assigned and discussed single-volume interpretation of Jefferson’s character.

### Scope & style
- **Scope:** Jefferson’s public life from the 1770s–1820s, with thematic chapters anchored to key episodes.
