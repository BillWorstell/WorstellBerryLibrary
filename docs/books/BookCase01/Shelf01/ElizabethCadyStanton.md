# *Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Feminist as Thinker* — DuBois & Cándida Smith, eds. (2007)

![Cover — *Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Feminist as Thinker*](ElizabethCadyStanton_Cover.jpg)

## Why read this
Stanton is usually remembered for Seneca Falls and suffrage. This reader shows her as a **theorist**—a combative, witty mind wrestling with marriage law, religion, race, and citizenship. It’s a compact way to meet Stanton’s voice directly, framed by scholars who explain why her arguments still matter.

## What it’s about (concise overview)
A curated selection of Stanton’s speeches, essays, and letters—paired with concise headnotes and interpretive essays—that trace her thinking from the 1848 *Declaration of Sentiments* through later campaigns for civil and marital reform. Themes include legal equality, women’s autonomy, religion and gender, and strategic/ideological rifts within the movement.
