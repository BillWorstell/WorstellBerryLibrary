# Elizabeth Cady Stanton, *Feminist as Thinker* — DuBois & Candida Smith, eds. (2007)

### Why read this
Stanton is usually remembered for Seneca Falls and suffrage. This reader shows her as a **theorist**—a combative, witty mind wrestling with marriage law, religion, race, and citizenship. It’s a compact way to meet Stanton’s voice directly, framed by scholars who explain why her arguments still matter.

### What it’s about (concise overview)
A curated selection of Stanton’s speeches, essays, and letters—paired with concise headnotes and interpretive essays—that trace her thinking from the 1848 *Declaration of Sentiments* through later campaigns for civil and marital reform. The editors foreground themes of legal equality, women’s autonomy, the role of the church, and fissures within the movement (especially over race and strategy). The aim is to restore Stanton as an original political thinker, not only an organizer.

### Table of contents (if readily available)
TBD

### Author & perspective
- **Editors:** Historian **Ellen Carol DuBois** (women’s suffrage) and **Richard Candida Smith** (American intellectual/cultural history).  
- **Perspective:** Scholarly but accessible. Documents are contextualized with brief essays that note where Stanton was pioneering, where she was divisive, and where her 19th-century assumptions show. Readers get both the **primary texts** and a roadmap to debates around them.

### Reception & impact
Adopted in many U.S. women’s history and political thought courses, the volume helped re-center Stanton’s intellectual contributions alongside activism. General readers appreciate the balance of documents and commentary; specialists value the clear thematic organization. (No single “definitive” review is cited here; mark specifics as found.
