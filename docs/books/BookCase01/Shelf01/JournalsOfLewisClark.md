# The Journals of Lewis and Clark — Edited by Bernard DeVoto (Houghton Mifflin)

### Why read this
Few adventure stories are as real—or as consequential—as the trek from the Mississippi to the Pacific and back (1804–1806). These journals place you in the canoe, on the portage, and at council fires, recording landscapes before settlement and first-contact diplomacy in the explorers’ own words.

### What it’s about (concise overview)
This volume presents a highly readable selection of the expedition’s daily journals, shaped into a continuous narrative by literary editor **Bernard DeVoto**. Drawn from the classic **Reuben Gold Thwaites** edition, it follows the Corps of Discovery from St. Louis up the Missouri, across the Rockies, down the Columbia to the ocean, and home again. The entries capture route-finding, mapping, natural history notes, weather, trade, and encounters with many Native nations. DeVoto’s linking passages and **Erwin Raisz** maps help modern readers track distance, season, and terrain.

### Table of contents (if readily available)
Coming soon

### Author & perspective
- **Primary voices:** Captains **Meriwether Lewis** and **William Clark**, with occasional entries by others. These are field notes—immediate, practical, and sometimes contradictory—written for documentation rather than for posterity.
- **Editor’s role:** **Bernard DeVoto** (mid-20th-century historian/essayist) abridged and arranged the texts for flow, supplying brief context where needed. Expect a focus on narrative momentum and geography over exhaustive transcription.
- **Perspective/bias:** U.S. government exploration during the early republic; the journals reflect their moment—curiosity, urgency, and the limits and assumptions of the expedition’s viewpoint.

### Reception & impact
DeVoto’s reading edition has been one of the most widely used single-volume gateways to the journals for general readers and classroom adoption. It keeps the immediacy of the originals while remaining portable—often the starting point before moving to full scholarly editions.

### Scope & style
- **Scope:** American West from the Mississippi watershed to the Pacific, **1804–1806**; riverine travel, mountain passes, wintering sites, diplomacy, and natural history.
- **Style:** Primary-source diary entries connected by brief editorial bridges; clear cartography; minimal academic apparatus.
- **Reading experience:** Episodic and vivid; lots of short entries, measurements, and cataloging of plants, animals, and supplies.

### Publication & readership
- **Type:** Trade **paperback**; Houghton Mifflin printing with a **1997** foreword by Stephen Ambrose (verify year/ISBN on your copy).
- **Audience:** General readers of exploration and U.S. history; students; travelers retracing the route; natural-history enthusiasts.
- **Apparatus:** Maps by **Erwin Raisz**; editor’s introduction and headnotes; index varies by printing.
