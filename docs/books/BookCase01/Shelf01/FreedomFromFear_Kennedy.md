# *Freedom From Fear* — David M. Kennedy (Oxford UP, 2005 pbk.)

### Why read this
A sweeping, authoritative narrative of how the United States weathered the **Great Depression** and fought **World War II**, tracing everyday lives alongside high policy. If you want one volume that explains how the New Deal and the war remade the nation, this is the modern classic.

### What it’s about (concise overview)
Kennedy moves from the 1929 crash and **Hoover**’s responses to **Franklin Roosevelt**’s New Deal experiments, the 1937–38 slump, and America’s cautious path from neutrality to total war. The second half covers strategy and production, the home front (race, labor, gender), and the global campaigns that culminate in 1945. Throughout, the book ties **state capacity**, **economic recovery**, and **social change** to the pressures of depression and mobilization.
