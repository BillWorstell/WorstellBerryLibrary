# *We Are Lincoln Men: Abraham Lincoln and His Friends* — David Herbert Donald

### Why read this
Pulitzer-Prize–winning historian **David Herbert Donald** (author of *Lincoln*) explores how a famously private president relied on a small circle of **trusted friends and confidants**. If you’re curious about the **human networks** behind Lincoln’s rise and leadership, this is an engaging, character-driven window into the era.

### What it’s about (concise overview)
Donald traces Lincoln’s friendships from **Springfield** through the **presidency**, showing how ties with figures such as politicians, law partners, neighbors, and military advisers shaped his **political judgment**, **emotional life**, and **governing style**. Rather than a cradle-to-grave narrative, the book is organized around **relationships**, arguing that Lincoln’s effectiveness came from a selective but durable reliance on a few people he trusted.
